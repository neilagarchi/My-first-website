# My-first-website
This is my first website I created as a prototype layout for a more modern and aesthetically appealing insurance company. Designed without prior experience, it reflects my early steps in web design and creative branding as it gives the customer a sense of belonging. 

This Website is created using WordPress and it's my very first so bear with me if you see Images from generated by Ai. 
The numeric folders are the static sets. 

Main code can be found in index file.
